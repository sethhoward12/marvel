			<h1 class="odd">Thor</h1>
			<h2 class="odd">Norse God of Thunder and Lightning</h2>

			<p>As the son of the king of all Norse gods, Odin, Thor grows up as Prince of Asgard.
				His mother and Odin's wife, Frigga, plays a very influential role in helping Thor
			prepare to be king one day.</p>
			<p>In the movie, Asgardians, or also known as &AElig;sir, are actually a species of extraterrestrial upbringing, keeping the form of humans though. They have highly advanced
				technology, which tends to be seen as a high magic that makes up their world.</p>
			<p>Conflict arises and everything changes when the Frost Giants, enemies of the gods', 
				attack. They traveled over the Bifr&ouml;st Bridge, bringing chaos and fear 
				to the people of Asgard.</p>
			<p>Loki, God of Mischief and Thor's adopted brother, attempts to take Asgard for himself.</p>
			<p>Thor must learn the hardships of being mortal on Earth while fighting for love and family.</p>
			<p>His weapon of choice is a hammer named Mj&oslash;lnir. Mj&oslash;lnir is not the source of Thor's power, it is used to control it. Thor's main power is controlling lightning.</p>
			<p>However this is not his only weapon that he used throughout the franchise. In the movie: Thro Ragnorok, Thor's hammer ends up being destroys by his sister hela. In Avengers Endgame Thor made a new weapon which was an axe and is called Stormbreaker.</p>
			<p>Thor is portrayed by Chris Hemsworth in the 8&plus; movies he is scripted in, including the
				new upcoming film of 2022 <i>Thor&#58; Love and Thunder</i>.</p>
			<p>As for comics, Thor made his first debut in <i>Journey into Mystery</i> &num;83
			that released in 1962.</p>
