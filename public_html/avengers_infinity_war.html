The Infinity Stones consisted of six stones that each had incredible power. Together Thanos could snap his fingers and do whatever he wanted with the stones. The Avengers were doing everything they could to keep the stones out of his grasp. Thanos's ultimate goal was to get all the Infinity Stones and snap half of all people to dust. He believed that was the best way to sustain life forever to get rid of overcrowding and limited resources. Obviously, this is really bad as half of the universes population would be killed. Ultimately after a crazy and massive fight Thanos managed to collect all the stones and complete his mission. This was a massive plot twist as the villian actually won.
